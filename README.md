# Football Manager
Easy web game about manageing your own football team.

<h3>Nice, clear interface</h3>
<p>It's not very complicated to play. All rules are written on the Main Page and you can easyli come back I check what to do.</p>
<p>At the beginning you have to Log In or Register (if you do not have an account). All personal informations are saved to database ONLY for Logging process.</p>

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>There is probably only one main rule - you can proceed until your energy let's you to do that. If it's not enough - just wait couple minutes for it to refill</p>
<p>Energy refills every minute thanks to CronTab module that was set on server and works constantly</p>

<h3>What's in the end?</h3>
<p>This game might never ends</p>
<p>After finishing one season you can start again with all the same teams, with your team but another opponents, or with all new teams (including yours)</p>
